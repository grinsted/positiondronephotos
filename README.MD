* Works even if some jpgs are missing. 
* Allows for shutter delay.
* Can use kalman filtered values instead of raw values (EKF1 messages instead)
* 

Project not done... 

Needs to test what are the best options for my setup. (A cumulus one, manual focus, shutterspeed 1/4000)




Relies on ATT, GPS, CAM, EKF1 messages in the log file
