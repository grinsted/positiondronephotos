Match a folder of jpgs to a mission planner log file in order to obtain camera position and orientation of all images. These can then be used with AGISoft Photoscan or similar

* Works even if some jpgs are missing. 
* Allows for shutter delay. Better implementation
* Can use kalman filtered values instead of raw values (EKF1 messages instead of ATT/CAM messages)
* 

Project not done... 

Need to test what are the best options for my setup. (A cumulus one, manual focus, shutterspeed 1/4000, sony qx-1)




Relies on ATT, GPS, CAM, EKF1 messages in the log file
